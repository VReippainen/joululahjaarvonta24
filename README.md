This repository contains code to perform the official Christmas present lottery for the Reippainen family. Other families are also welcome to use this project for their own Christmas present lottery.

## Requirements

- A recent version of Python 3; this project was tested with Python 3.13.0.

## Getting Started

To run the lottery, simply execute:
```
python main.py
```

If you would like to test the code, you can run the unit tests. When the code passes all unit tests, it should be ready for the actual lottery. The tests can be run with the following command:
```
python test_lottery.py
```

## Your task
The lottery.py file contains a draw_lots function that takes the names of family members as an array and should return a dictionary pairing each family member with another. Currently, the function returns an empty dictionary. Your task is to implement the required functionality. More information can be found in lottery.py.
